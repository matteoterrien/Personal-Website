          Created a robust dashboard containing location and information of
          backflow devices for an internship at Swift Comply. Using a python
          script, I was able to update the data kept in the ArcGIS feature
          layer. The project was a proof of concept for Swift Comply in order
          for them to be able to help their clients view the backflow devices on
          a friendly and easy to use mapping plateform.

          The Vera Project is a student-designed website that focuses on the
          central goal of enhancing accessibility to mental health resources for
          Cal Poly students. This project seeks to provide a centralized
          repository of resources, including those available on campus, in the
          local community, and at the national level. Additionally, it serves as
          a platform for students to share and read personal stories related to
          their experiences with mental health. The overarching aim of The Vera
          Project is to create a supportive and informative environment that
          empowers students to navigate their mental health journey.

          Working in team to integrate artificial intelligence in finding
          missing people for search and rescue missions. I am currently working
          on the frontend side of the project helping create an easy to use and
          navigate website for search and rescue personel to input forms and
          notes for the artificial intelligent agents to parse.
